Let's test when we do various changes to a file, how different branches would be merged when we create a pull request


Now this is in the second branch. 
Or rather the branch that will submit a pull request last after the firsttest branch has already submitted it's pull request and 
after the first branch has already been merged.

Just as a btw, can you tell the difference between l1I. hahahaha. in this one it is easily identifiable



in this first test one, 
we are editing below the file, just to see what happens when one branch is merged before the other one has been merged.

Are the changes overwritten or does it add the new functionality

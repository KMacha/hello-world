Let's test when we do various changes to a file, how different branches would be merged when we create a pull request

Now this is in the second branch. 
Or rather the branch that will submit a pull request last after the firsttest branch has already submitted it's pull request and 
after the first branch has already been merged.

Just as a btw, can you tell the difference between l1I. hahahaha. in this one it is easily identifiable
